## Why go through the effort?
Creating your own website isn't exactly a walk in the park. Even someone with some coding experince - like myself - struggled for a good few hours to get a grip on the basics of HTML and CSS. I guess the alure lies in that your creation is entirely yours, and that you have full control over it. Website creation these days has become super simplified and abstracted - low-level knowledge is now completely useless. 

### How would I?
To simplify the process of complicating the process of creating ones' own website, we make use of GitHub Pages. Pages allows one to host a small static webiste with a "github.io" domain name for free. Pages has a super helpfull step-by step instruction guide on how to setup your website, available at <!-- insert a link here -->.

### What can I do with it?
Absolutely anything. Your website is essentially your little playground. Create blog posts, create a page dedicated to your favourite gif's, create a collection of your favourite recipes with links, or even embedd all your favourite songs into a page dedicated to the task.
You can do whatever you want, and learn valuable coding skills in the process.
