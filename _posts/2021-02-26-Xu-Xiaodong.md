## Who is the Mad Dog?
Xu Xiaodong is a Chinese MMA fighter renowned for tackling some of the biggest fraudulent martial artists out there. His passion for exposing these fakes has consequently led to death threats from the Chinese government and a severly handicapped social credit score. (See my blog on China's social credit system) The Chinese government despises him, due to the fact that he publicly outs and challenges fake martial arts experts.
