## Who is the Mad Dog?
Xu Xiaodong is a Chinese MMA fighter renowned for tackling some of the biggest fraudulent martial artists out there. His passion for outting the fake has consequently led to a severly handicapped social credit score, and even death threats from the Chinese government. (See my post on China's social credit system) The Chinese government despises him due to the fact that he publicly outs and challenges martial arts experts who claim martial arts superior to other fighting forms.

It started in 2017 when Xu came across a Tai Chi master, Wei Lei, who claimed he could escape a rear naked choke with only one hand. Xiaodong challenged Lei's claims, leading to Lei retorting and posting Xiaodongs personal cellphone number online. Xiaodong was met with numersous death threats and hate. Xiaodong consequently flew to Lei's city in order to settle the argument in a public MMA versus Tai Chi match. Unsurprisingly, Lei was out cold within 20 seconds. 

And this is the trend that Xiaodong's life tends to follow - a martial arts expert makes boastful claims about their art, they are challenged and demolished without fail, and the Chinese governement is angered and finds a way to punish or threaten him. Although the reason the government is so hostile to Xiaodongs expose is a rather childish one.

The Chinese martial arts are ancient, somewhat cultural forms of fighting. They would be better defined as forms of physical meditation, such as yoga or pilates. When it comes to fighting, the arts often prove less than effective against even an inexperienced boxer, kickboxer, or MMA fighter. This is due to the arts entailing many unnecesary movements, and few, if any, tactical techniques. 

This being said, martial arts definitley still have a place in the world, but certainly not as fighting techniques. They have much cultural significance, which should be preserved through their practice. However, purported matial arts masters should refrain from making bold claims about the efficacy of their arts, lest they themselves become responsible for the ridiculing of their art. 

Xu Xiaodong is, objectively, entirely innocent. The Chinese government would do well to encourage these martial arts masters to stop perpetuating boastful falsehoods about the arts, and instead focus on making people aware of their cultural significance.
