## I am Mikail Kieser

And this website exists purely for fun. Kinda reminds me of the Oracle Think.net pages we used to have in primary school.
I'll post literally anything I want here - memes, gifs, music, blogs about things. It's essentially another creative outlet for me.
And whilst I'm creating this webiste, I'll be learning some CSS and HTML along the way - an bonus.

I'm current 22 years old. I studied Electronic Engineering at the University of Pretoria from 2017 to 2020 (4 years), during which I officially finished 2 years of the degree. Due to multiple years of me not giving my best 24/7, the difficulty of the degree compunded and ultimately rendered me helpless. I'm certain I wouldn't have been able to finish it if I hadn't gone back to first year. I'm currently in the process of reapplying to the university for a different degree - A bachelors degree of IT in Inforation Science, specializing in Entrepeneurship. 

So, I do have a mild background in coding, and a comparatively extensive one in computers. I know Python, some C++, a little Assembly and some VHDL - all languages used extensively by engineers. Fortunately, the basics remain the same across most languages, so picking up HTML, CSS and Javascript isn't proving to be too difficult for me
