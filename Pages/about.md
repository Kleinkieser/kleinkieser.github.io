## I am Mikail Kieser

And this website exists purely for fun. Kind of reminds me of the Oracle Think.net pages we used to have in primary school.
I'll post literally anything I want here - memes, gifs, music, blogs about things. It's essentially another creative outlet for me.
And whilst I'm creating this webiste, I'll be learning some CSS and HTML along the way - a bonus.

I'm currently 24 years old. I studied Electronic Engineering at the University of Pretoria for a few years, but didn't complete the degree. I'm currently in my final year of studying BIT Information Systems.

So, I do have a mild background in coding, and a comparatively extensive one in computers. I know C#, SQL, HTML, CSS and JS/TS, some C++, and a little Python. I've even touched some Assembly and VHDL! Fortunately, the basics remain the same across most languages, so picking up new ones isn't proving to be too difficult for me.
