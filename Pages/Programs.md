random little programs, like calculators, calendars, etc. Looking at p01 for inspo.

File name changer - Removes specified characters, and replaces with a specified character. Can remove strings as well.

Basic interest rate calculators.

Maybe like a photo filter program - apply filters to a photo.

They'll have to be JS apps running in-browser, as Pages doesn't allow dynamic webpages.
