            And this website exists purely for fun. Kinda reminds me of the Oracle Think.net pages we used to have in primary school.
            I'll post literally anything I want here - memes, gifs, music, blogs about things. It's essentially another creative outlet for me.
            And whilst I'm creating this webiste, I'll be learning some CSS and HTML along the way - a bonus.

            I'm currently 23 years old. I studied Electronic Engineering at the University of Pretoria for a few years, but didn't complete the degree. I'm currently in my second year of studying BIT Information Systems (Entrepreneurship).

            So, I do have a mild background in coding, and a comparatively extensive one in computers. I know Python, C# some C++, a little Assembly and some VHDL - all languages used extensively by engineers. Fortunately, the basics remain the same across most languages, so picking up HTML, CSS and Javascript isn't proving to be too difficult for me.
